# GitHub Flow for Zeituna Project

## Overview

This document outlines the recommended GitHub workflow for the Zeituna project. It covers branch naming conventions, pull request (PR) process, code review guidelines, and deployment steps to ensure smooth collaboration and code quality.

---

## Branch Naming Conventions

- **Main Branch:** `main` (or `master`)
- **Feature Branches:** `feature/feature-name` (e.g., `feature/user-auth`)
- **Bug Fix Branches:** `fix/bug-description` (e.g., `fix/login-error`)
- **Hotfix Branches:** `hotfix/issue-description` (e.g., `hotfix/critical-security-patch`)
- **Release Branches:** `release/vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `release/v1.0.0`)

---

## Pull Request (PR) Process

1. **Create a Branch:**

   - Create a new branch from `main` using the naming convention above.
   - Example: `git checkout -b feature/user-auth`

2. **Develop & Commit:**

   - Make changes, commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages.
   - Example: `git commit -m "Add user authentication logic"`

3. **Push & Create PR:**

   - Push your branch to GitHub: `git push origin feature/user-auth`
   - Create a PR on GitHub, targeting the `main` branch.
   - Fill in the PR template with:
     - Description of changes
     - Related issue(s)
     - Screenshots (if applicable)
     - Testing steps

4. **Code Review:**

   - At least one reviewer must approve the PR.
   - Address feedback and update the PR as needed.

5. **Merge:**
   - Once approved, merge the PR into `main`.
   - Delete the feature branch after merging.

## Code Review Guidelines

- **Code Quality:**

  - Follow project coding standards (TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier).
  - Ensure tests pass and coverage is maintained.

- **Documentation:**

  - Update relevant documentation (e.g., README, API docs).
  - Add comments for complex logic.

- **Security:**
  - Check for security vulnerabilities (e.g., dependency updates, input validation).

---

## Deployment Steps

1. **Staging Deployment:**

   - After merging to `main`, trigger a staging deployment.
   - Run automated tests and manual QA.

2. **Production Deployment:**
   - If staging is successful, trigger a production deployment.
   - Monitor logs and metrics for issues.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

- **Automated Tests:**

  - Run unit tests, integration tests, and linting on every PR.
  - Ensure all tests pass before merging.

- **Deployment Automation:**
  - Use GitHub Actions or similar tools to automate deployments.
  - Example workflow:
    ```yaml
    name: Deploy
    on:
      push:
        branches: [main]
    jobs:
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - name: Deploy to Staging
            run: ./deploy-staging.sh
          - name: Deploy to Production
            run: ./deploy-production.sh
    ```

---

## Best Practices

- **Keep Branches Updated:**

  - Regularly rebase or merge `main` into your feature branch to avoid conflicts.

- **Small, Focused PRs:**

  - Keep PRs small and focused on a single feature or fix.

- **Clear Communication:**
  - Use PR descriptions and comments to communicate clearly with reviewers.
